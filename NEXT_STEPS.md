git tag backup-before-autolink-migration

# 2. Remove manual linking (follow MIGRATION_GUIDE.md steps 2.1-2.3)
cd packages/openchs-android
rm react-native.config.js  # or move to .backup
rm android/app/src/main/java/com/openchsclient/CustomPackageList.java

# (Edit in your IDE)
```

**Afternoon** (2-3 hours):
```bash
# 4. Clean build
cd packages/openchs-android/android
./gradlew clean
rm -rf .gradle build app/.gradle app/build

# 5. Test build
./gradlew assembleGenericDebug

# 6. Initial verification
aapt list app/build/outputs/apk/generic/debug/app-generic-arm64-v8a-debug.apk | grep "\.so$" | wc -l
# Should show 16-20 libraries (not 13)
```

---

### Migration Day 2 (4-6 hours)

**Morning** (2-3 hours):
```bash
# 7. Runtime testing
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/generic/debug/app-generic-arm64-v8a-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.openchsclient/.MainActivity

# 8. Check logs
adb logcat | grep -E "UnsatisfiedLink|ReactNative|MainActivity"

# 9. Test core features
- Subject registration
- Form filling  
- Offline sync
- Realm database
- Firebase analytics
```

**Afternoon** (2-3 hours):
- Fix any package-specific issues
- Test edge cases
- Performance testing
- Document any issues found

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan

If migration fails:
```bash
# Immediate rollback
git reset --hard backup-before-autolink-migration

# Or restore previous branch
git checkout feature/rn-0.81.4-android-15-upgrade

# Clean and rebuild
cd packages/openchs-android/android
./gradlew clean assembleGenericDebug
```

### Backup Strategy

- ✅ Git tag before migration
- ✅ Previous branch preserved
- ✅ Known working APK saved
- ✅ Database backup (if needed)

---

## 🎯 Decision Points

### Go/No-Go Criteria

**Proceed with migration if**:
- ✅ Team approved
- ✅ Testing window available
- ✅ Rollback plan clear
- ✅ Documentation reviewed

**Delay migration if**:
- ⚠️ Critical release pending
- ⚠️ Team capacity unavailable
- ⚠️ Major dependencies changing
- ⚠️ Unclear requirements

---

## 💡 Quick Wins

### What You Get

**Short Term**:
- ✅ No more UnsatisfiedLinkError crashes
- ✅ All 19 packages working
- ✅ React Native 0.81.4 features
- ✅ Android 15 compatibility

**Long Term**:
- ✅ Standard React Native approach
- ✅ Easier package updates
- ✅ Lower maintenance overhead
- ✅ Better community support
- ✅ Future RN upgrades easier

## 📞 Support Resources

### If You Get Stuck

**Reference Materials**:
1. MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Step-by-step instructions
2. FINAL_SUMMARY.md - Context and reasoning
3. Test App - /tmp/TestRN81App (working example)

**Troubleshooting**:
- Check MIGRATION_GUIDE.md "Troubleshooting" section
- Compare with TestRN81App configuration
- Check logcat for specific errors

**Common Issues**:
1. PackageName error → Remove react-native.config.js entirely
2. CustomPackageList not found → Good! Remove from MainApplication
3. Firebase crash → Check google-services.json
4. Icons missing → Run `npx react-native-asset`
